# Snake Game
This is a browser-based Snake Game where the player controls a snake to eat food and avoid obstacles. As the snake eats food, it grows longer, and the game increases in difficulty with speed and more obstacles appearing over time.

## Features:
**Player Mode**: The player controls the snake using arrow keys.
**Obstacle**s: Randomly generated obstacles appear on the board, which the snake must avoid.
Obstacles are placed using an algorithm that ensures they don’t block essential game areas like the snake’s starting position or food spawn points.
**Score Tracking**: Displays the current score, which increases as the snake eats food.
**Increasing Speed**: As the snake eats more food, its speed gradually increases.
**Responsive Design**: The game works seamlessly on both desktop and mobile devices.

2.Avoid hitting the walls, your own snake body, or obstacles that appear on the grid.
